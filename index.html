<!-- M2-D2 ASSIGNMENT TOPIC
You are creating a website to showcase your favourite music albums.
In this page you will have a short biography section about yourself, the top albums of your life, 
the worst album you ever listened to and everything related to the music you love.

ASSIGNMENT RULES
- The project must be pushed to a new repository and linked in EduFlow by the end of the day.
- You can google / use StackOverflow BUT we suggest you to use just the material provided and documentation.
- To test the page, open it with your browser and inspect it with developer tools / device emulator.
- Use Bootstrap4.6 classes to create the page.
- Use containers, rows and cols in order to achieve a great responsive layout.

NOTE:
Even the most experienced designers need inspiration.
Spend some time surfing the web researching the best way of representing the albums you love.
Could be the Amazon way, the Spotify or Apple music way or any other music collection out there.

HINT: Manage your time in order to finish the structure and responsiveness before focusing on the details.

    <style>
        /* EXERCISE 1
            For every Album displayed in the page we'd like to have a consistent appearence.
            Create the template of an Album component (you can start from a bootstrap one or create your own)
            You will use it to display every album in the page.
            
            You should have consistency in these elements:
            - The album card
            - The album cover
            - The album title
            - The album group / singer / dj
            - The album genre
            - The album duration
            - etc

            create CSS rules to style them if needed
            ...to make sure every Album component looks the same.
         */

    <!-- EXERCISE 2 
            Implement a navigation bar using the bootstrap component
            This navigation bar must link every section in your page.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 3
            Create a responsive section for your favourite albums.
            In this section you should have:
            - 4 albums per row when the screen is very large
            - 3 albums per row when you are on a tablet (or a smaller viewport)
            - 2 albums per row when you are on a small screen
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 4
            Create a section for the album reviews.
            Pick one of your favourite albums, and create a section with:
            - Cover Image
            - Title
            - Band
            - Duration
            - Genre
            - Tracklist
            - ... And whatever you think it's interesting about it!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
            Worst album list! Choose the albums you dislike or some you think are overrated and list it
            in this "hall of shame" chart! 
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
            Do you have any musician / band you admire or you are a fan of?
            This section is dedicated to him / her / them!
            Feel free to experiment in this part of the page.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "squared" (use CSS to achieve that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice tapestry effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links.
        -->

    <!-- ############ EXTRA:
        EXERCISE 9
            Create an album details area which will be toggled on and off by clicking on the album image.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible).
            (hint: look for a boostrap component that can handle the job for you. You can always rely on DOM manipulation if you can't find it)
        -->

    <!--
         EXERCISE 11
            Add in the footer the number of how many ALBUMS are present on the page. 
            Create the JavaScript logic that runs when the page finished loading and 
            counts the albums and applies the number in the area of the footer you've previously decided.
